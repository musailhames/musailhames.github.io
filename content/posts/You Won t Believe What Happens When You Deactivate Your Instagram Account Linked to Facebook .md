## Effects on Facebook

One of the most obvious effects of deactivating your Instagram account linked to Facebook is the removal of all your Instagram activity from your Facebook profile.

In addition to the removal of Instagram activity and the loss of access to shared photos and videos, deactivating your Instagram account linked to Facebook can also cause other changes to your Facebook profile.
