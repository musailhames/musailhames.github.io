## What Does it Mean to be Blocked on Instagram?

Being blocked on Instagram means that the person who blocked you won’t be able to see your posts, stories, or messages. They also won’t be able to search for your profile or view any of your photos or videos.

## Why Would Someone Block You?

There are a few reasons why someone might block you on Instagram. They may be trying to avoid seeing your posts, they might not want to interact with you, or they may simply not want to be connected with you anymore.

## Overview of 5 Steps to Find Out if You’ve Been Blocked

1. Check Your Followers List
2. Check Your Messages
3. Search for Their Profile
4. Check Your Comments
5. Ask a Friend

## Step 1: Check Your Followers List

The first step to finding out if someone has blocked you on Instagram is to check your followers list. To do this, navigate to your profile and click on the “Followers” tab. Once you’re there, you’ll be able to see who is following you. If the person who you think has blocked you is not on the list, then they have likely blocked you.

## Step 2: Check Your Messages

The next step is to check your messages. To do this, navigate to the “Messages” tab and look for any messages from the person who you think has blocked you. If you can’t find any messages from them, then they have likely blocked you.

## Step 3: Search for Their Profile

The third step is to search for their profile. To do this, go to the search bar at the top of the page and type in the name of the person who you think has blocked you. If you can’t find their profile, then they have likely blocked you.

## Step 4: Check Your Comments

The fourth step is to check your comments. To do this, navigate to the “Comments” tab and look for any comments from the person who you think has blocked you. If you can’t find any comments from them, then they have likely blocked you.

## Step 5: Ask a Friend

The fifth and final step is to ask a friend. Ask your friend if they can see the person’s profile or if they have received any messages from them. If they can’t see the profile or have received any messages, then they have likely blocked you.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, there are five steps that you can take to find out if someone has blocked you on Instagram.
