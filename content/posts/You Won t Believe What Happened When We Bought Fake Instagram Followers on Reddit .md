## Buying Fake Instagram Followers on Reddit

We decided to take the plunge and find out what would happen if we bought fake Instagram followers from Reddit. We were curious to see how easy it was to buy fake followers, and what the results would be. 

### The Process

The process of buying fake followers on Reddit was surprisingly easy. All we had to do was search for the hashtag “#buyfakefollowers” and there were dozens of posts offering to sell us fake followers. We chose one of the posts and sent a direct message to the person offering to sell us the followers. They asked us for our Instagram username and then sent us a link to a website where we could pay for the followers. We paid for the followers and within a few minutes, we had thousands of new followers on our Instagram account. 

### The Results

The results of buying fake followers on Reddit were not what we expected. After we bought the followers, our Instagram account was quickly flagged by Instagram for suspicious activity. We were unable to post anything on our account and all of our posts were removed. We were also unable to access our account for several days. 

## Conclusion

The process of buying the followers was surprisingly easy, but the results were not what we expected. We were quickly flagged by Instagram for suspicious activity and our account was inaccessible for several days. We would not recommend buying fake followers on Reddit as it can have serious consequences.

The results of our experiment buying fake Instagram followers on Reddit were shocking. We found that despite the low cost of the followers, the quality of the followers was extremely poor. The followers had no profile pictures, no posts, and no engagement with our account. Furthermore, the followers were quickly removed by Instagram, leaving us with fewer followers than before we made the purchase. 

In conclusion, buying fake Instagram followers on Reddit is not a wise decision. The quality of the followers is low, and the risk of getting caught and having your account suspended is high. It’s much better to build your audience organically, by creating engaging content and interacting with other users. Doing so will ensure that your followers are real, engaged, and here to stay.
