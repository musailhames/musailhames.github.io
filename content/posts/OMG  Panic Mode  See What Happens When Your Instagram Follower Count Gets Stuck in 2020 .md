## Introduction

2020 has been a roller coaster ride for many of us, and Instagram is no exception. With the rise of user-generated content, changes in Instagram’s algorithms, and technical issues, many Instagram users have found themselves stuck in a panic mode as their follower count has stagnated or even decreased. In this blog post, we’ll explore the causes of this issue, as well as potential solutions to help you get your follower count back on track. 

## What is Instagram?

Instagram is a social media platform where users share photos, videos, and stories. It’s a great way to connect with friends and family, discover new trends, and build a personal brand. With over 1 billion active users, it’s no wonder why Instagram has become one of the most popular social media platforms. 

## What is the issue with Instagram follower count in 2020?

Many Instagram users have noticed that their follower count has stagnated or even decreased in 2020. This can be a frustrating experience, as it can feel like you’re putting in a lot of effort without seeing the results. This issue has been caused by a combination of technical issues, changes in Instagram’s algorithms, and user-generated content. 

## Causes of the Problem

### Technical Issues

The first cause of the issue is technical issues. Instagram is constantly making changes to its platform, and these changes can sometimes lead to glitches that can affect your follower count. For example, some users have reported that their follower count has not been accurately reflected in their profile. 

### Changes in Instagram’s Algorithms

The second cause of the issue is changes in Instagram’s algorithms. Instagram is constantly adjusting its algorithms to improve the user experience, and these changes can sometimes lead to a decrease in your follower count. For example, Instagram recently changed its algorithm to prioritize content from accounts that the user interacts with frequently. This means that if you’re not engaging with your followers, your content may not be seen by as many people. 

### User-Generated Content

The third cause of the issue is user-generated content. Instagram is a competitive platform, and users are increasingly creating content that is more engaging and creative than ever before. This means that if you’re not creating content that stands out, your follower count may suffer. 

## Solutions

### Re-Engaging with Followers

The first solution is to re-engage with your followers. If you’ve been inactive on Instagram, now is the time to start engaging with your followers again. Respond to comments, like posts, and share content that is relevant to your audience. This will help you build relationships with your followers and make them more likely to engage with your content. 

### Utilizing Other Social Media Platforms

The second solution is to utilize other social media platforms. Instagram is just one of many social media platforms, and it’s important to diversify your presence across multiple platforms. This will help you reach a larger audience and increase your follower count. 

### Creating Unique Content

The third solution is to create unique content. It’s important to stand out from the crowd and create content that is engaging, creative, and relevant to your audience. This will help you attract more followers and keep them engaged. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, many Instagram users have found themselves in a panic mode as their follower count has stagnated or even decreased in 2020. This is due to a combination of technical issues, changes in Instagram’s algorithms, and user-generated content. Fortunately, there are solutions to this issue, such as re-engaging with followers, utilizing other social media platforms, and creating unique content. It’s important to stay active on Instagram and to understand how its algorithms work in order to keep your follower count growing.
