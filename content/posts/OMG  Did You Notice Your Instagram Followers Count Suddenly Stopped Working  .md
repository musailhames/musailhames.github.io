## I. Introduction

It can be incredibly frustrating when something you rely on suddenly stops working. If you’ve been relying on your Instagram followers count to track your progress and see how your account is doing, you may have noticed that it suddenly stopped working. It’s natural to feel panicked and frustrated, but don’t worry, there are some things you can do to figure out what’s going on and get your followers count back up and running.

## II. Possible Causes

The most common cause of an Instagram followers count not working is a technical glitch. This could be anything from a problem with Instagram’s servers to a problem with your device or internet connection. It’s also possible that you’ve been blocked from seeing the followers count due to a policy violation or if you’ve been flagged for suspicious activity.

## III. Solutions

If you’re experiencing a technical issue, the first thing you should do is try restarting your device and checking your internet connection.

If that still doesn’t work, you can reach out to Instagram’s support team to see if they can help you troubleshoot the issue.

If you’ve been blocked from seeing your followers count, you should review Instagram’s policies to make sure you haven’t violated any of their rules. If you have, you’ll need to take steps to correct the issue in order to get your followers count back up and running.

No matter what the cause of your followers count not working is, it’s important to take action quickly to ensure that your account remains in good standing. With a little bit of troubleshooting, you should be able to get your followers count back up and running in no time.
