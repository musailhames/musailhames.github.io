## What are Instagram Reels?
Instagram Reels are short-form videos that are posted on Instagram. They are usually 15 to 30 seconds long and are often accompanied by music or other sound effects. They are often used for entertainment purposes, such as to showcase a funny moment or to show off a skill. 

## Why Instagram Reels can be Disruptive on Facebook Feeds
The problem with Instagram Reels is that they can be disruptive on Facebook Feeds.

### Disable the “recommended for you” feature
The first step you can take is to disable the “recommended for you” feature. This feature is located in the settings of your Facebook account and it allows Facebook to show you content that it thinks you may be interested in.

### Block Instagram Reels from appearing in your feed
The third step you can take is to block Instagram Reels from appearing in your feed. This can be done by going to the settings of your Facebook account and selecting the “Block Instagram Reels” option. This will stop any Instagram Reels from appearing in your feed.
