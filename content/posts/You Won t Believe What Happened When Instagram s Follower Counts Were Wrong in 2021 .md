The world of social media was thrown into chaos when Instagram's follower counts were wrong in 2021. Many users were shocked to see their follower count suddenly plummet or skyrocket without explanation. It was a confusing and frustrating time for many, but it also revealed a valuable lesson in the power of intent. Intent is what drives us to post content, engage with others, and create relationships on social media. While follower counts are important, it is ultimately the intent behind each post that matters most. Instagram's mistake serves as a reminder that it is the quality of our content and our interactions that will determine our success on social media, not the number of followers we have.
