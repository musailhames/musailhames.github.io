It also allows you to delete photos, but the process can be a bit tedious when done on a computer. Fortunately, there is a simple trick that can help you delete Instagram photos quickly and easily on your computer.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Deleting Instagram Photos Instantly

To delete Instagram photos on your computer, you will need to download a third-party app. There are many available, but we recommend using the Instagram Deleter app. Once you have downloaded and installed the app, log in with your Instagram credentials.

Using this trick has a few benefits. First, it is much faster than deleting photos manually on Instagram’s website. Second, it is much easier to use, as you don’t have to navigate through menus and other steps.

The process is a bit more tedious, but you can do it by logging into your Instagram account and navigating to the photo you want to delete.
